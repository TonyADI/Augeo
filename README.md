# Augeo
Augeo is latin for enlarge/expand.
The basis of the application is to allow users create products which other users can then bid on. 
All the products in a category are assumed to be new and of the same model and type. No discrenpancies are allowed.
The products also have a duration which gives a sense of urgency to the whole thing.
The project is a long way from being complete but I would say there is some basic functionality in it. 
The platform is supposed to be somewhat similar to a free market seeing as the users control the price of each category.
I do not intend to make this an actual platform/website rather I am using it as a learning experience and a place to hone my skills.

## Current Functionalities
- Users can currently create an account, login, logout, create a product/listing, bid on products or outright buy them.
- Form validation for register, login and create product.
- The products have a timeout function which works by assigning the product to the user with the highest bid when the duration expires.
- Retrieve products based on different search queries such as popular, recent, etc. 
- Expired products or products that have been bought are not displayed to users in the home and browse page.
- Users can view their listings, bids and purchases in the account page.
- Users cannot view their own listings on the home or browse page.
- Users can modify their personal details and password.
- Improved security in server and backend.

## Future Functionalities
- New categories can be added but they would need to be authorized first.
- The platform is also going to work based on its own currency. Seeing as users need to be able to bid as soon as possible and getting them to fill in their bank information while trying to bid for a product that ends in 5 seconds is not very user friendly.
- An address table will be added as well as an address form in the account page.
- Ability to send messages between the seller and the buyer of the product.
- Archive a listing if it has no current bids, and archive a listing that has been purchased.
- Delete expired bid records upon the users request.
- A robust search functionality for a product list.
- A minimum and maximum constraint will be placed on the product prices.
